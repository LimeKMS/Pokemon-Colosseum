# Pokemon-Colosseum
School Project to make a python-based Pokemon game, a user will play a 3 on 3 Pokemon battle where the Pokemon are randomly selected.
The player will fight against Team Rocket to see who will win!
The Pokemon and their move sets are held on two external files.

Internal: PokemonColosseum.py (main program)

External: moves-data.csv (pokemon move data sheet), pokemon-data.csv (list of pokemon and their moves), README.md (documentation/instruction)


To run this program, the user must enter the following lines of code with the files all in the current directory:

python PokemonColosseum.py
